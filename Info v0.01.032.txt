Fixed (Changed):

1. The scales of the T and X including the signal lines is updated and they continue to update whenever we zoom in(out)
		Before, whenever we moved the screen, we would have seen the end of the line
		which would make the event parallels buggy as they would not connet to any line
2. The parallel line scales of the events sometimes did not update while zooming in(out)
3. The user cannot zoom out too much

Small Fixed (Changed):

1. Zoom speed is decreased substantially

Optimized:

Issues:

1. You can move the screen as much as you want (it is an issue because the user can get lost in the program)

What's Next: 

1. I will prevent the user from moving the screen endlessly

2. Lines will have a constant length only its thinkness will be changed whenever we zoom in or out (CANCELED)
		The Feature was canceled due to optimization problems
		I added the Feature and then shortly after removed it because of the fact that this feature made 2 times more calculations 
		than the fix I added instead. 
		
		Lets discuss why this feature multiplied the number of calculations.
		If we would have given a constant length to the T and X lines, that would have made us to update both the position and the 
		length of the Rotator object whenever zooming in and out, and it would do the same calculation whenever we enable the edit mode.
		Instead the scale(length) of the lines are updated at the time the they are drawn and they are updated whenever there are 2 touches
		on the screen (zooming in and out)
