Relativision is an application for visualizing the spacetime. The initial version was created for the Relativity class and then updated to 
the current version for the Software Engineering class. The user can add the X and T axis, modify them by rotating them. 
Also, events can be added to the spacetime diagram and modified by moving them. The parallels to the axis is automatically calculated, 
for example by adding an event, or deleting an axis, the parallels are automatically updated. The program also has save/load system, 
thus the graphs can be fully saved and accessed later.
